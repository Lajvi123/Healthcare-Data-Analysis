# Healthcare-Data-Analysis

## Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to explore and analyze healthcare data related to diabetic patients to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns that can assist in improving patient outcomes. 

## Dataset Description 
The dataset used for this project is the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1998â€“2008 Dataset, obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008). It contains over 100,000 records of diabetic patient encounters in hospitals, capturing demographic details, medical history, hospital procedures, and patient outcomes.

## Project Highlights 
1. Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
2. Developed visualizations to depict trends in hospital stays, demographic distributions, and medical outcomes.
3. Used statistical and machine learning techniques to explore correlations and causal relationships in the data.

## Main Questions Addressed in the Project
1. What is the distribution of patients across different age groups, races, or genders?
2. What is the overall distribution of the length of hospital stays?
3. What are the most common diagnoses among patients?
4. Is there a correlation between the number of lab procedures and the length of hospital stay?
5. Do certain races or age groups tend to receive more lab procedures or medications?
6. Is there a relationship between the number of medications prescribed and readmission rates?
